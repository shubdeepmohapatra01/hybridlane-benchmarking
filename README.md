<h1 align="center">hybridlane</h1>

**hybridlane** is a Python library for designing and manipulating **hybrid continuous-variable (CV) and discrete-variable (DV) quantum circuits** within the [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/) ecosystem. It provides a frontend for expressing hybrid quantum algorithms, implementing the concepts from the paper Y. Liu *et al*, 2026 ([PRX Quantum 7, 010201](https://doi.org/10.1103/4rf7-9tfx)).

## ✨ Why hybridlane?

As quantum computing explores beyond traditional qubit-only models, `hybridlane` offers a powerful and intuitive framework for researchers and developers to:

*   **Design complex hybrid circuits effortlessly:** Seamlessly integrate qubits and qumodes in the same circuit.
*   **Describe large-scale circuits:** Define hybrid gate semantics independently of simulation, enabling fast description of wide and deep circuits with minimal memory.
*   **Leverage the PennyLane ecosystem:** Integrate with PennyLane's extensive tools for transformations, resource estimation, and device support.

---

## 🚀 Features

*   **📃 Hybrid Gate Semantics:** Precise, platform-independent definitions for hybrid gates, enabling rapid construction of large-scale quantum circuits.

*   **⚛️ Native Qumode Support:** Qumodes are treated as a fundamental wire type, with automatic type inference that simplifies circuit construction and enhances readability.

*   **🤝 PennyLane Compatibility:** A familiar interface for PennyLane users. Utilize existing PennyLane gates, build custom hybrid devices, write compilation passes, and perform resource estimation across mixed-variable systems.

*   **💻 Classical Simulation:** Dispatch to our Jax-compatible simulator and take gradients using automatic differentiation, or use [Bosonic Qiskit](https://github.com/C2QA/bosonic-qiskit).

*   **💾 OpenQASM-based IR:** An intermediate representation based on an extended OpenQASM, promoting interoperability and enabling advanced circuit manipulations.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```python
import numpy as np
import pennylane as qp
import hybridlane as hl

# Create a simulator with a custom Fock truncation
dev = qp.device("default.hybrid", fock_level=8)

# Define a hybrid circuit with familiar PennyLane syntax
@qp.qnode(dev)
def circuit(n):
    for j in range(n):
        qp.X(0)  # Wire `0` is inferred to be a qubit
        # Use hybrid CV-DV gates from hybridlane
        hl.JC(np.pi / (2 * np.sqrt(j + 1)), np.pi / 2, [0, "m"])

    # Mix qubit and qumode observables
    return hl.expval(hl.N("m") @ qp.Z(0))

# Execute the circuit
expval = circuit(5)
# array(5.)

# Perform wire type checking
res = hl.type_check(circuit)(5)
print(res.wire_types)
# OrderedDict({0: Qubit(), 'm': Qumode()})
```

## 🗺️ Roadmap

`hybridlane` is under active development. Here are some of our future goals:

*   **Broader measurement support:** Including mid-circuit measurements and broader measurement capabilities.
*   **Algorithms and transformations:** Implementing popular algorithms and circuit transformations from research papers, including dynamic qumode allocation.
*   **Symbolic Hamiltonians:** Introducing support for symbolic bosonic Hamiltonians.
*   **Noisy simulation:** Supporting noisy simulations with Bosonic Qiskit.
*   **Pulse-level gates:** Allowing pulse-level gates and simulating them in Dynamiqs.
*   **Catalyst/QJIT support:** Integrating with PennyLane's `qjit` capabilities by developing a custom MLIR dialect.
*   **Community-driven features:** Incorporating features requested by the community during usage.

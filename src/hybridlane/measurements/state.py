def state(wires: Wires | None = None) -> "StateMP":
    r"""State measurement process.
    Analogous to Pennylane's state measurement (:py:func:`qp.state`), but the logic of this measurement process should be handled by the device since the state is entirely dependent on the fock cutoffs set by the device.

    .. attention:: The device level implementation should preserve Pennylane's lexicographical ordering -- ie the 'top' wire is the most significant bit in the statevector.


    **Examples**
    -------
    .. code-block:: python
        :emphasize-lines: 8

        def circuit():
            hl.FockState(  # set mode 1 to fock state 1 using qubit 0 as ancilla
                1, [0, 1]
            )
            hl.FockState(  # set mode 2 to fock state 2 using qubit 0 as ancilla
                2, [0, 2]
            )
            return hl.state()

    The returned statevector should correspond to the state :math:`\lvert 0,1,2 \rangle` (with cutoffs of 2,4,4)
    so the state :math:`\lvert 0,1,2 \rangle` corresponds to the index 6 in the statevector (since (0)*4*4 + (1)*4 + (2)*1 = 6).

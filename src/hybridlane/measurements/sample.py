    If an observable is given, this method samples the eigenspectrum (!) of the observable, returning
    one eigenvalue per shot. The observable must have a recipe for diagonalizing it in some set of
    computational bases.

    When sampling wires without an observable, unlike in the DV (qubit) case, there are multiple possible
    computational bases to use (see :py:class:`~hybridlane.measurements.measurement.ComputationalBasis`).
    Therefore, one must provide a :py:class`~hybridlane.measurements.measurement.BasisMap` specifying what
    basis to measure each wire in. Note that it'll likely be easier to perform homodyne (:math:`\hat{x}`) or Fock
    (:math:`\hat{n}`) measurements by supplying the corresponding observable rather than manually constructing
    the appropriate schema.

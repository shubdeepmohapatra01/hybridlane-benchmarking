    """Circuit pass that validates a wire is only used as a qubit or a qumode

    This validates that once a wire is used in an operation as a qubit or a qumode, that its
    role remains the same in the rest of the circuit. This is physically motivated since a device
    cannot perform swap gates between qubits and qumodes (there would be truncation issues).

    Example

    .. code:: python

        # This would throw an error
        def bad_circuit():
            qp.Displacement(alpha, 0, wires=[0])
            qp.X(1)
            qp.H(0) # error: wire 0 became a qumode earlier during Displacement

    Args:
        tape: The quantum circuit to check

        fill_missing: An optional string of ``("qubits", "qumodes")`` specifying what default
            to provide for unidentified wires

    Raises:
        :py:class:`~hybridlane.sa.StaticAnalysisError` if any wire is used as both a qubit and a qumode across the circuit, or
        if its type cannot be inferred and no default is provided.

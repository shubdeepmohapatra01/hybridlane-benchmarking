Device details (``sandiaqscout.hybrid``)
----------------------------------------

The device supports up to 6 qubits (ions) and their associated motional modes. By
default, the center-of-mass (COM) modes are disabled due to their higher noise
levels, but they can be enabled by setting the ``enable_com_modes`` option to
``True`` when initializing the device. Thus for a circuit with :math:`n` qubits,
there are :math:`2n-2` motional modes available by default, or :math:`2n` if the COM
modes are enabled.

**Wires** The device supports hardware wires and virtual wires. Hardware qubits are
addressed with integers :math:`0` to :math:`5`, while motional modes are addressed
using the :class:`~hybridlane.jaqal.Qumode` object or strings of the form
``"m{manifold}i{index}"``, where ``manifold`` is ``1`` for the lower motional
manifold and ``0`` for the upper manifold, and ``index`` is the index of the mode.

Example with hardware wires:

.. code:: python

    dev = qp.device("sandiaqscout.hybrid", use_virtual_wires=False, n_qubits=4)

    @qp.set_shots(10)
    @qp.qnode(dev)
    def circuit():
        hl.FockState(3, [0, "m1i2"])
        return hl.expval(qp.Z(0))

    print(qp.draw(circuit)())

When using hardware wires, the user is responsible for ensuring that gates adhere to
any constraints. Additionally, for optimal performance, the qubits and qumodes should
be chosen to maximize coupling strengths to reduce gate time. The lower manifold (1)
has stronger couplings.

By default, the device uses virtual wire allocation to assign physical wires to
virtual wires based on constraints of the gates in the circuit. This can be
disabled by setting ``use_virtual_wires`` to ``False`` when initializing the
device, in which case the circuit must use only physical wires.

Example with virtual wires:

.. code:: python

    qp.decomposition.enable_graph()
    dev = qp.device("sandiaqscout.hybrid", n_qubits=4)

    @qp.set_shots(10)
    @qp.qnode(dev)
    def circuit():
        hl.FockState(3, ["q", "m"])
        return hl.expval(qp.Z("q"))

    print(qp.draw(circuit, level="device")())

Note that virtual wire allocation does not yet perform any ranking for valid solutions
or noise-aware compilation.

**Native gates**: The native gate set includes common qubit gates and some hybrid gates,
particularly implementing the Sideband ISA :footcite:p:`liu2026hybrid`. The native
gates are available in :mod:`hybridlane.devices.sandia_qscout.ops` and currently
include:

- **Qubit gates**: :math:`R_\phi, R_x, R_y, R_z, S, S^\dagger, S_x, S_x^\dagger, XX, YY, ZZ`
- **Hybrid gates**: :math:`JC, AJC, xCD, yCD, zCD, xCS, BS`

Exporting to Jaqal
------------------

To run on the ion trap, circuits need to be exported to the Jaqal
:footcite:p:`morrison2020just` language. Hybridlane provides the
:func:`~hybridlane.devices.sandia_qscout.to_jaqal` function to convert a QNode to a
Jaqal program. By using that function on a QNode bound to the QSCOUT device, the
resulting Jaqal program will be optimized for the device's native gate set and
constraints.

Example:

.. code:: python

    dev = qp.device("sandiaqscout.hybrid", n_qubits=2)

    @qp.set_shots(1024)
    @qp.qnode(dev)
    def circuit(alpha):
        hl.SqueezedCatState(alpha, np.pi / 2, parity="even", wires=["q", "m1i1"])

    to_jaqal(circuit, level="device", precision=4)(4)

This will return a Jaqal string, where each tape of the QNode batch is encoded as a
subcircuit.

.. code::

    from Calibration_PulseDefinitions.QubitBosonPulses usepulses *

    register q[2]

    subcircuit {
        xCD q[1] 1 1 4.0 0.0
        Rz q[1] 11.00
        xCD q[1] 1 1 0.0 0.09817
        yCD q[1] 1 1 -0.09817 -0.0
        Sz q[1]
    }
